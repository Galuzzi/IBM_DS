# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

## Overview

This repository contains my projects, notes, and resources from the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** program on Coursera. This comprehensive program consists of 10 courses that provide the latest job-ready tools and skills in data science, including open source tools and libraries, Python, databases, SQL, data visualization, data analysis, and machine learning.

#### Course Provider
**IBM** in partnership with **Coursera**

## Course Content

The professional certificate includes the following courses:

1. **What is Data Science?** - Introduction to the field of data science
2. **Tools for Data Science** - Overview of popular tools used by data scientists
3. **Data Science Methodology** - Introduction to the methodology used for solving data science problems
4. **Python for Data Science, AI & Development** - Learn Python programming fundamentals
5. **Python Project for Data Science** - Apply Python skills in a project
6. **Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python** - Learn SQL and work with databases
7. **Data Analysis with Python** - Learn how to analyze data using Python
8. **Data Visualization with Python** - Create meaningful visual representations of data
